# tumblr-post-saver
This repository will host the code for a tumblr post saver.

The first version will barely have any options to do much else besides download images from tumblr pages into an '.\images' folder.

Next few versions I want add a few things

1.  Saving the HTML of posts. (we can parse and save to a database later, maybe mongoDB on aws?)
2.  Saving user data? To be clear not OTHER user data, only ours. (or whoever is using it)
3.  Saving extension/addon data. Like music playlists and resources to blogs

Then I'm up for any requests or just close the project.
